Welcome to my repository of HackTheBox machine writeups!

I update this repo every Saturday with new writeups of retired HTB machines. Each writeup includes detailed steps, methodologies, and insights gained during the process.

Future Plans:

    Adding PicoCTF challenge writeups
    Expanding with TryHackMe machine writeups

Stay tuned for more updates!
